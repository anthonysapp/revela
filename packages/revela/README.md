# Revela — section & page transition animation engine

Tiny, strongly‑typed TS engine that wires **reveal‑on‑scroll sections** and **Swup page transitions** into one clean lifecycle. Bring your own styles; Revela gives you structure, discovery, and motion primitives (via Motion One).

See `/examples/demo` for a runnable demo.
